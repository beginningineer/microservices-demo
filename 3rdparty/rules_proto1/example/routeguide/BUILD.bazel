# This generates a set of routeguide_test rules, one for each combination of
# client & server. The way most routeguide clients are written, they don't
# actually fail hard if the routeguide procedure does not go as planned.
# Generally, the tests should range between 2-10 seconds.
# If tests are abnormally fast it likely signals an error that should be
# investigated.
#
# TODO(user): rewrite the clients to fail fast.
